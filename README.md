# Prismatic

A colorful, curated, and clean modpack,  
for Minecraft 1.21.1 and Fabric 0.18.4.  

It won't hold your hand, nor jump in your face,  
so you can have fun all at your own pace!  

## A colorful world awaits...

**Prismatic** is built on the principle of content without clutter,  
adding just enough to excite without requiring a wiki.  

Mods are integrated to reward engagement, but don't require it,  
so your adventure is up to *you*. That's Minecraft, isn't it?

## Notes

Bring your own shaders if you like!
1. Install Iris and Colorwheel for Vanillin compatibility.
2. Remove Particle Rain and Wakes, as they don't play well with shaders.

Some advice for admins:
- I recommend playing on hard!
- Game rules won't affect your experience! Feel free to turn off Phantoms.
- [Spectrum](https://modrinth.com/mod/spectrum) requires certain biomes to progress, so set a large world border.
- Remove [Chunk Loaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/chunk-loaders) from the pack if your players can't be trusted.
- Run on Java 25 with these arguments:
  - -Xms8G -Xmx8G -XX:+UseZGC -XX:+UseCompactObjectHeaders
  - Why? [Read the manual](https://exa.y2k.diy/garden/jvm-args/).
